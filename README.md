# Why this app?

I was often missed some meetings even when I'm in front of my macbook. Somehow I often missed that small notification. After consult with AI, it suggested me some solutions and one of the solution is the paid app named "In Your Face". I was used it, the trial version and was a little bit suprised with the price. Not that expensive, but considered that actually I already invested some money in AI services, I was thought why don't I "create" it by myself with vibe coding. TLDR, so this app created. Enjoy!
